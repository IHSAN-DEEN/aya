# Contributing to the Book of Deeds 📚

> "When a person dies, his deeds come to an end except for three: Sadaqah Jariyah (a continuous charity), or knowledge from which benefit is gained, or a righteous child who prays for him." (Muslim)

Assalamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullah! 👋

We are incredibly humbled that you want to contribute to `aya`. Think of every line of code you write here as a form of **Sadaqah Jariyah**—knowledge that will benefit others long after we are gone.

Whether you're fixing a bug (removing a bad habit), adding a feature (learning a new Sunnah), or improving documentation (sharing Ilm), your efforts are recorded not just in `git log`, but in a Record far more permanent.

## 🌟 The Code of Conduct (Adab)

Just as we have Adab in our daily lives, we have Adab in our code:

1.  **Ikhlas (Sincerity)**: Code with the intention to help others.
2.  **Ihsan (Excellence)**: Write clean, readable, and efficient code. "Allah has prescribed Ihsan in all things."
3.  **Respect**: Treat fellow contributors with kindness and patience.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

1.  **Fork the Repository**: Create your own copy of the project.
2.  **Create a Branch**: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`.
3.  **Code with Ihsan**: Implement your changes.
4.  **Test**: Ensure your changes don't break existing functionality.
5.  **Commit**: `git commit -m "feat: Add new prayer time calculation"`.
6.  **Push**: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`.
7.  **Open a Pull Request**: Submit your PR (Make a Dua for its acceptance!).

## 🐛 Found a Bug?

If you find a bug, please open an issue. Consider it a form of *Naseehah* (advice) to the maintainers. Be gentle in your description, and we will try our best to fix it InshaAllah.
