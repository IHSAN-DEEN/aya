> "And We have fastened every man's deeds to his neck, and on the Day of Resurrection, We shall bring out for him a book which he will find wide open." (17:13)

Look, we live in a world of inputs and outputs. We spend our days in the terminal, typing commands, expecting results, fixing bugs, and pushing code. We are meticulous about our version control. We worry about our commit history. We stress over merge conflicts.

**But have you ever stopped to think?**

What about the repository of your life? What about the "issues" in your heart? What about the "commits" that the Angels are recording right now?

That's why we built **aya**. It's not just a CLI tool. It's a mindset shift. It takes the language you already know—`git`, `status`, `push`, `pull`—and reorients it to help you track the most important project you will ever work on: **your soul**.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Bismillah)

You want to get started right away? Bismillah. Just copy this and you're good to go.

```bash
# 1. Install it globally (so you can access it from anywhere)
npm install -g islamic-cli

# 2. Set your intention (Niyyah) for the session
aya init

# 3. Check where your heart is at
aya status
```

## 🔄 The Workflow (The Daily Grind)

You see, the life of a believer is a constant cycle. It's not a straight line. You slip, you get back up. You commit a mistake, you seek forgiveness. We mapped this spiritual reality to your developer workflow.

| Command | The Concept | The Spiritual Reality |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `aya init` | **Niyyah** (Intention) | Before you write a single line of code, you have to ask yourself: *Why am I doing this?* If the intention is for Allah, the code becomes worship. |
| `aya status` | **Muhasabah** (Audit) | You run `git status` to see what changed. `aya status` asks: *What changed in you?* Are you mindful? Or are you in *Ghaflah* (heedlessness)? |
| `aya commit` | **Amal** (Deed) | Every smile, every prayer, every bug fixed with patience—that's a commit. And unlike git, you can't `reset --hard` these commits. So make them count. |
| `aya push` | **Dua** (Supplication) | You have anxieties? You have bugs you can't fix? You have needs? Push them up. The server is always up. The connection is direct. |
| `aya pull` | **Rizq** (Provision) | We think we are the ones generating success. No. We just pull from the provision that was already written for us. Ask for guidance, and pull it down. |
| `aya blame` | **Nafs** (Self) | When something breaks, we look for who to blame. The believer looks in the mirror. *Nafs al-Lawwama*—the self-reproaching soul. It's healthy to admit your faults. |
| `aya diff` | **Furqan** (Criterion) | Are you the same person you were yesterday? Or have you improved? This command helps you distinguish your growth. |
| `aya repo` | **Kitab** (Book) | Imagine if you could see your Book of Deeds right now. This command opens a UI to visualize your spiritual contributions. It's eye-opening. |

## 🛠️ The Toolkit (Equip Yourself)

A believer doesn't go into the battlefield unarmed. You need tools. You need reminders.

### 🕌 Worship & Practice

| `aya wudu` | It's not just washing limbs. It's washing away the minor sins of the last few hours. |
| `aya tasbih` | Keep your tongue moist with the remembrance of Allah. It's light on the tongue, heavy on the scale. |
| `aya fast` | Discipline the body to feed the soul. It's a detox for your character. |
| `aya zakat` | Your wealth isn't yours. You're just the manager. Purify it. |

| :--- | :--- |
| `aya nature` | Look at the sky. Look at the trees. They are all submitting. Are you? |
