> "And We have fastened every man's deeds to his neck, and on the Day of Resurrection, We shall bring out for him a book which he will find wide open." (17:13)

Listen, we need to talk.

We live in a world of inputs and outputs. We spend our days in the terminal, typing commands, expecting results, fixing bugs, and pushing code. We are obsessed with our GitHub contribution graphs. We worry about our commit history. We stress over merge conflicts.

**But have you ever stopped to think?**

What about the repository of your life? What about the "issues" in your heart that have been open for years? What about the "commits" that the Angels are recording right now, at this very second?

That's why we built **aya**.

## 💡 The "Insider" Story: Why We Built This

You want to know the truth? This isn't just another developer tool. It’s a response to a modern problem.

We live in a time where we are hyper-connected to our repositories but disconnected from our purpose. We track every line of code, but we lose track of our spiritual state.

We realized something profound: **We are optimizing our code, but we are not optimizing our lives.**

The idea is simple yet radical: What if the very tools we use to build the dunya could be used to build our akhirah? What if `git status` could remind you of your status with Allah?

That is why **aya** exists. It is a bridge. It takes the language you already know—`git`, `status`, `push`, `pull`—and reorients it to help you track the most important project you will ever work on: **Your Soul.**

## ❓ Why "aya"?

People ask me, "Why did you call it aya?"

Look at the linguistics. In Arabic, **Ayah** (آية) doesn't just mean a "verse" of the Quran. It means a **Sign**. It means a **Miracle**. It means **Evidence**.

Every line of code you write can be an *ayah*—a sign of Allah's perfection. Every bug you fix can be a lesson. The sun is an ayah. The wind is an ayah. And this tool? It's a humble attempt to turn your terminal into a series of *ayat*—reminders that point you back to Him.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Bismillah)

You want to get started? Bismillah. It’s simple.

```bash
# 1. Install it globally (make it part of your system)
npm install -g @ihsandeen/aya

# 2. Set your intention (Niyyah) for the session
aya init

# 3. Check your connection to the Heavens
aya status
```

## 🔄 The Workflow (The Real Daily Grind)

You see, the life of a believer is a constant cycle. It's not a straight line. We mapped this spiritual reality to your developer workflow.

| Command | The Spiritual Reality (The "Why") |
| :--- | :--- |
| `aya init` | **Niyyah (Intention)**<br>Before you write a single line of code, ask yourself: *Who is this for?* If it's for ego, it's wasted. If it's for Allah, even a `console.log` becomes worship. This command sets that frame. |
| `aya status` | **Salah & Connection Check**<br>You run `git status` to see changed files. `aya status` checks your *connection to the Divine*. It tells you: "Your heart is currently on branch 'dunya'." It checks if you've missed prayers. It's a reality check. Are you online with Allah, or did you timeout? |
| `aya diff` | **The Precision of Divine Speech**<br>This isn't comparing two files. This is comparing *words*. Why did Allah use *this* specific word here and not its synonym? `aya diff` challenges you with linguistic nuances. It shows you that the Quran isn't just poetry; it's precision engineering. |
| `aya commit` | **Amal (Deed)**<br>Every smile, every charity, every moment of patience—that's a commit. And unlike git, you can't `reset --hard` these commits once the time passes. Make them count. |
| `aya push` | **Dua (Supplication)**<br>You have anxieties? You have bugs you can't fix? Push them up. The Server is always listening. The bandwidth is infinite. |
| `aya pull` | **Rizq (Provision)**<br>We think we generate success. No. We just pull from the provision that was already written. Ask for guidance, and pull it down. |
| `aya blame` | **Nafs (Self-Reproach)**<br>When code breaks, we check `git blame` to find the culprit. The believer looks in the mirror. *Nafs al-Lawwama*—the self-reproaching soul. It's healthy to admit your faults. |
| `aya repo` | **Kitab (Book of Deeds)**<br>Imagine if you could see your Book of Deeds right now. This command opens a UI to visualize your spiritual contributions. It's eye-opening. |
