## What is this? 🤔

Look, we're developers. We live in the terminal. We track everything with `git`. We worry about commit history, merge conflicts, and production bugs.

**But what about the most important repository of all?**
The repository of your **life**.

`aya` is a CLI tool designed to bring the mindfulness of Islam into your daily developer workflow. It uses the metaphors of version control to help you track your spiritual state, manage your "issues" (sins/struggles), and maintain a clean "commit history" (good deeds) for the Ultimate Code Review on the Day of Judgment.

It's not just a tool; it's a **mindset**.

## 🚀 Features (The "Stack")

### `aya init` • The Niyyah (Intention)
Just like you initialize a repo, you need to initialize your intention. Start your day or your coding session by setting your Niyyah.
```bash
$ aya init
? What is your intention? Seeking the pleasure of Allah through code.
```

### `aya commit` • Record a Good Deed
Did you smile at your brother? Pray on time? Help a junior dev? That's a commit.
```bash
$ aya commit -m "Helped a neighbor with groceries"
[main 8f3a21] Commit confirmed. Angels are recording.
```

### `aya status` • Muhasabah (Self-Reflection)
Check your spiritual state. Are you in a state of heedlessness (ghafha) or remembrance (dhikr)?
```bash
$ aya status
Your heart is currently on branch 'dunya'.
Warning: 3 prayer times missed.
Suggestion: run 'aya wudu' to refresh session.
```

### `aya push` • Dua (Supplication)
Upload your needs to the Cloud above. No server downtime. 100% uptime.
```bash
$ aya push
Connecting to the Arsh...
Request sent. Trust in the response.
```

### `aya blame` • Istighfar (Seeking Forgiveness)
Who broke the build? Usually, it's our own nafs. Acknowledge your mistakes.
```bash
$ aya blame
Author: You
Reason: Anger
Action: Say Astaghfirullah.
```

### `aya repo` • The Book of Deeds UI
Visualize your spiritual journey with a beautiful, GitHub-style interface. See your contribution graph (prayers/deeds), manage your "issues", and view your stats.
```bash
$ aya repo
Opening your Book of Deeds in the browser...
```
