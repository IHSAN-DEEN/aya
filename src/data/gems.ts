    text: "So verily, with the hardship, there is relief.",
    source: "Surah Al-Sharh (94:5-6)",
    reflection: "Notice the grammar: 'Al-Usr' (the hardship) is definite—it's known, specific, and singular. 'Yusr' (relief) is indefinite. This means for every one hardship you face, there are multiple, infinite reliefs coming from Allah. The hardship is limited; the relief is unlimited."
  },
  {
    text: "And He found you lost and guided [you].",
    source: "Surah Ad-Duhaa (93:7)",
    reflection: "The word 'daallan' doesn't just mean lost; it implies being overwhelmed, confused, or desperately seeking a way out. Even when you feel intellectually lost in your code or life, He finds you. You don't find Him; He finds you."

  {
    text: "Call upon Me; I will respond to you.",
    source: "Surah Ghafir (40:60)",
    reflection: "Allah uses 'Astajib' (I will respond) immediately. He didn't say 'I might' or 'eventually'. The response is guaranteed. The moment the du'a leaves your heart, the answer is already in motion."

  },
  {
    text: "Read! In the Name of your Lord, Who has created.",
    source: "Surah Al-Alaq (96:1)",
    reflection: "The first command was 'Iqra' (Read/Recite). Knowledge is the first step to connection. Before you code, read. Before you execute, understand. Connect your learning to 'Rabbik' (your Lord) to give it purpose."
  },
  {
    text: "And speak to people good [words].",
    source: "Surah Al-Baqarah (2:83)",
    reflection: "Not just 'truthful' words, but 'husna'—beautiful, best, kindest words. Even in code reviews. Even in error messages. Your words should bring 'husn' (beauty) to the world."

    source: "Surah Al-Baqarah (2:286)",
    reflection: "The word 'wus'aha' implies capacity. If you are facing a bug that seems impossible, know that the solution is within your capacity. Allah wouldn't have put this problem in front of you if you didn't have the 'RAM' to handle it."
  },
  {
    text: "And your Lord is going to give you, and you will be satisfied.",
    source: "Surah Ad-Duhaa (93:5)",
    reflection: "Not just 'happy', but 'satisfied' (Raadiya). Happiness is temporary; satisfaction is a state of being. Allah promises a future where you will look back at your struggles and say 'It was worth it.'"

    source: "Surah Hud (11:61)",

  {
    text: "So flee to Allah.",
    source: "Surah Ad-Dhariyat (51:50)",
    reflection: "Usually when you fear something, you run away from it. But when you fear Allah, you run *to* Him. He is the only refuge from His own decree. When the dunya chases you, run to the Creator of the dunya."

    source: "Surah An-Nur (24:35)",
